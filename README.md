# hello-world

Welcome to the world of GitHub!

Welcome to my GitHub portfolio building experience.

My name is Jordan Karl. I am embarking on the journey to become a software developer and using GitHub for my current projects.
I enjoy shredding the gnar of life, whether carving powder with my snowboard or stacking lines of code. Python is my language of choice, but I also know HTML, CSS, and C# to name a few.
